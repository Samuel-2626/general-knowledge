# IoT

The internet has its humble origin in the government program called `ARPANET`; a United States Defense infrastructure designed to exchange resources across vast distances through computers.

A server is a special computer connected directly to the internet.

Webpages are files on that servers hard drive.

Every server as a unique protocol address or IP address.

IP address help computers find each other.

Computers you and I use every day are called "Clients" because they are connected indirectly to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP).

Everything connected directly or indirectly to the internet has an IP address. e.g. computers, servers. cell phones, etc.

Anywhere two or more parts of the internet intersect, there's a piece of equipment called a router. Routers direct your packets around the internet; helping each packet get one step closer to its destination.

Wireless networks includes more than just cellphones; Near Field Communication (NFC) is a somewhat generic term for the ability of two devices between close proximity to establish communications and transfer data through radio waves.

Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation. A radio wave has a much longer wavelength than visible light. Humans use radio waves extensively for communcations.

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a type of passive wireless technology that allows for tracking or matching of an item or individual.

The system has two basic parts; tags and readers. The reader gives off radio waves and gets signals back from the RFID tag, while the tag uses radio waves to communicate its identity and other information.

The technology has been approved since before the 1970s but has become much prevalent in recent years due to its usage in things like global supply chain management and pet microchipping.

RFID technology uses radio waves to identify people or objects. There is a device that reads information contained in a wireless device or "tag" from a distance without making any physical contact or requiring a line of sight.

1G was launched in 1979 presented in Tokyo for the first time. With 1G, only voice calls were possible.

2G was launched in 1991 (GSM).

3G was first implemented in Japan in 2001.

4G was first implemeted in Sweden & Norway in 2009.

5G was first implemented in South Korea in 2019.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a worldwide network of things, or physical objects, that contain embedded electronic, sensors and network connectivity that allow them to collect and exchange data.

IoT is a system of interrelated devices connected to the Internet to transfer and receive data from one to the other.
